- 对比学习综述 contrastive ssl in RS
    table2's recommendation task includes: graph-based CF and knowledge graph etc.
  - About graph-based CF, read Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Web-Scale Recommender Systems
    - youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed0NJdqwEyg
  - knowledge graph：RippleNet: Propagating User Preferences on the Knowledge Graph for Recommender Systems
- 7.1 因为涉及到graph-based CF的细节越来越多，所以先去了解graph-based的论文
    - 先读pinSage，了解图CF的结构
    - Self-supervised Graph Learning for Recommendation首次将对比学习引入到图中
- 7.3 技术周会分享了新的网络架构SSM：Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces，应该先学习graph-CF
